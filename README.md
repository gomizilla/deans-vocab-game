This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

# Dean's Vocab Game
This webapp allows English teacher's in Japan to utilize gamification to help students learn English vocabulary. 

The MVP of this webapp (frontend/backend) was developed within a week. *It is still under development.*

# Features

## Easier Wordle

Wordle game feature adapted for Japanese JHS students. Modified so that user's have unlimited tries to guess the correct word. For use in the classroom *the student with the least amount of guesses* would be the winner.

Current Iteration:
- User guess a five-letter word
- Unlimited tries

## Word Scramble

A set of words that have been scrambled. The user must type in the correct answer for each word to complete the game. 

For example: plpeaepni => pineapple

Current Iteration:
- 10 words displayed
- Words based on JHS year 1 level vocabulary

# Future Features
- User login/registration for teachers
- Separate home screen for teachers/students
- Word customizability for logged in Teachers
- Drop down menu for students to choose their teacher
    - This would set their game vocab to what teacher was chosen
- Multiple Choice game
